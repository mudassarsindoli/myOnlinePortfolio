            <h2>#02 | Mechanical to Software : Why am I taking this Leap?</h2>
            <p>As a fresh mechanical engineer myself working at a company, I often find myself feeling unfulfilled or dissatisfied with the career path I have chosen. I am seeking for a new challenge, a new opportunity to grow, or a way to align my interests with my professional aspirations. One such option that I found is to make a career change from mechanical engineering to software development. <br><br>

                There are several reasons why I am considering this shift.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Firstly, the demand for software developers is rapidly increasing, with projections indicating a 22% growth rate in the field between 2019 and 2029. This growth is due in part to the increasing reliance on technology in all aspects of modern life, from business to entertainment to healthcare. By transitioning to software development, I can position myself at the forefront of this trend and take advantage of the many career opportunities it presents. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Secondly, software development offers a wide range of roles and responsibilities, allowing you to find a niche that aligns with your interests and skillset. There are lot of areas to specialize in software development such as  front-end development, back-end development, mobile development, or another area of focus. (I have chosen Front End as a start to begin with!) This flexibility means that we can customize our career path to suit your strengths and passions, and continually evolve as the industry changes.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third, software development can offer a more dynamic and collaborative work environment than mechanical engineering. While mechanical engineering often involves working on long-term projects that require months or even years of planning and execution, software development is characterized by a rapid pace of iteration and innovation. This pace can be invigorating and exciting, as we collaborate with our colleagues to develop and implement new ideas in real-time.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fourth, software development offers the opportunity to work remotely, which can be a significant advantage for those seeking a better work-life balance or more flexible working arrangements. Many software development roles can be done entirely online, allowing us to work from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. This can be especially attractive to those who value autonomy and independence in their work.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Finally, a career change to software development can provide a sense of renewed purpose and fulfillment. If we feel stuck or stagnant in our current career, pursuing a new path can be a way to reignite our passion and sense of purpose. By choosing a career that aligns with our interests and values, we can create a more meaningful and fulfilling professional life.<br><br>

                Of course, making a career change is not without its challenges. We will need to acquire new skills, build a network of contacts in the industry, and potentially take a pay cut or start at a lower-level position. However, if we are committed to the process and willing to put in the effort, the rewards can be significant. To make a successful transition from mechanical engineering to software development, we may want to consider taking online courses or attending coding boot camps to build our skills and demonstrate our commitment to the field. We can also network with software developers and attend industry events to gain insight into the industry and build connections with potential employers.<br><br>
                
                In conclusion, a career change from mechanical engineering to software development can be a rewarding and fulfilling choice for those seeking a new challenge or a way to align their interests with their professional aspirations. With the increasing demand for software developers and the flexibility and innovation that the field offers, there has never been a better time to explore this option. By committing to building our skills, networking with professionals in the industry, and maintaining a positive and proactive mindset, I believe we can create a successful and satisfying career in software development. Good Luck for your Future! <br>Peace!</p>

            <h2>#03 | Paid Courses : Are they worth the money?</h2>
            <p>Learning new skills is an essential part of personal and professional growth. With the rapid advancement of technology and changes in the job market, it has become even more important to stay updated with the latest skills and trends. However, learning new skills can be a daunting task, especially if you don't have access to the right resources or guidance. That's where paid courses come into the picture. In this blog, we will discuss whether paid courses are worth it or not, from my perspective. <br><br>

                To begin with, let's first understand what paid courses are. Paid courses are online or offline courses that require a fee for enrollment. These courses can range from a few hours to several weeks or months and cover various topics and skillsets. Some popular paid course providers include Coursera, Udemy, edX, Skillshare, and LinkedIn Learning.
                
                The first question that comes to mind while considering a paid course is, "Are they worth the money?" The answer to this question depends on several factors, such as the quality of the course, the reputation of the provider, the relevance of the content, and the level of commitment and dedication you put in. In general, paid courses can provide you with a structured learning path, expert guidance, and access to high-quality resources, which can help you learn more efficiently and effectively. <br><br>
                
                One of the significant advantages of paid courses is that they offer a wide range of options and flexibility. You can choose from different providers, courses, and formats depending on your budget, schedule, and learning preferences. For example, if you prefer self-paced learning, you can opt for a course that allows you to learn at your own pace. On the other hand, if you prefer interactive learning, you can choose a course that includes live sessions or discussion forums.
                
                Paid courses can also provide you with a sense of accountability and motivation. Since you have paid for the course, you are more likely to take it seriously and commit to completing it. Additionally, paid courses often have assessments, quizzes, or projects that allow you to test your knowledge and skills and receive feedback from experts. This feedback can help you improve your learning and identify areas where you need to focus more. <br><br>
                
                However, paid courses are not without their limitations. The biggest disadvantage of paid courses is that they can be expensive, especially if you opt for courses from reputed providers or those that offer certifications. Additionally, paid courses may not always provide you with the practical experience and real-world application of skills that you may need to succeed in your career.
                
                Another concern with paid courses is that they may not be suitable for everyone. If you have a tight budget or prefer informal learning, you may find free resources, such as online tutorials or blogs, more useful. Moreover, if you have prior knowledge or experience in the field, you may not need to enroll in a paid course and can learn the skill on your own. <br><br>
                
                In conclusion, whether paid courses are worth it or not depends on several factors. If you are serious about learning a new skill, have a budget to spare, and prefer structured learning with expert guidance, paid courses can be a good investment. However, if you are on a tight budget or prefer informal learning, free resources may be a better option. Ultimately, the decision to enroll in a paid course should be based on your personal goals, preferences, and circumstances. <br><br><br></p>
