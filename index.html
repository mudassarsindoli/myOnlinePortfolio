                As a Graduate Engineer Trainee at AEQUS Aerospace Manufacturing Pvt. Ltd, the work I did here was
                primarily focused on aerospace manufacturing, Also the skills I gained have proven to be highly
                transferable to the tech industry. During my time at AEQUS, I was responsible for designing and
                analyzing aerospace components using specialized software tools such as CATIA. This experience helped me
                develop my problem-solving abilities as well as attention to detail, both of which are essential in web
                development. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of my experience at AEQUS was the emphasis on
                collaboration and teamwork. Aerospace manufacturing is a highly collaborative field, and I learned to
                work closely with engineers and other professionals to achieve common goals.
                <br>While, the transition from aerospace manufacturing to web development may seem like a significant leap, I am confident that the skills I gained at AEQUS have prepared me well for this new challenge. My experience has taught me to approach problems with creativity and persistence, and to work
                collaboratively to achieve common goals. I am excited about this new chapter in my career and look
                forward to applying the skills I gained to new challenges and opportunities in web development.
