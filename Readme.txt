Hello.

My name is Mudassar and I am a Front End Developer. I have made my personal profile on Github a while ago using very basic functionalities of HTML and CSS. I did not used java script because I did not knew javascript at that time.

But now I have redesigned my profile using HTML, CSS & a bit of JavaScript. I believe,  its a lot better from the previous version of my profile. I am really excited to learn React.js and I have started learning it. I am also willing to create amazing projects using React. 

So thats it and hope you have a Great day ahead. Thanks for reading.

Peace!
